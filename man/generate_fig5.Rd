\title{Generate Figure 5}
\usage{
generate_fig5(postdir, outdir, sp_trends, status = TRUE,
  save_plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{postdir}{A filepath specifying where the species level posteriors have been saved.
If outputs have not been moved, this will be in a directory "/POSTERIOR_SAMPLES".}

\item{outdir}{A filepath specifying where the outputs of the function are to be saved.}

\item{sp_trends}{A dataframe, downloaded from the repository which details the species
level trends in occupancy and the years for which data were avaialble for each species.}

\item{status}{Logical. If TRUE the species name being worked on will be printed to the console.}

\item{save_plot}{Logical.  If `TRUE`, the plot will be saved as a PDF file
within the `outdir`. Default is `TRUE`.}
}
\description{
This takes the posterior estimates for each species and the species trend estimates
downloaded from the repository, calculates the average occupancy across the time frame
of each species for whihch data were available and generates figure 5 of the
associated paper.
\code{generage_fig5} function estimates species level average occupancy and generates figure 5.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

# Run generate_fig5 function to produce plot of average occupancy against
# trend in occupancy.
# datadir should be the filepath of where the posterior samples are saved.
generate_fig5(postdir = "/POSTERIOR_SAMPLES", outdir = getwd(),
sp_trends = read.csv(paste0(datadir, "/Species_Trends.csv")))
